# Rankr 

Rankr is service to store and evaluate user scores and rankings.

# Installation

Rankr is built based in docker. That's you need to install docker first, this
may need elevated permission, so you should probably run some commands
with `sudo` in front of it. Before you do so keep in mind that "with a great
power comes a great responsibility".

To install rankr go to the scripts folder

```user@server# cd scripts```

And execute the installer

```user@server:~/scripts# . install.sh ```
